Yes, generally, a .NET application running on an ARM64 processor can be slower than the same application running on an x64 (Intel/AMD) processor. This difference in performance is primarily due to the underlying architecture differences and the way the .NET Common Language Runtime (CLR) handles code translation and execution on each platform. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:

* Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):
ARM and x64 have different ISAs. x64 is a superset of x86, meaning that x64 processors can execute x86 instructions directly. However, ARM's ISA is incompatible with x86/x64, so .NET applications compiled for x64 need to be recompiled or translated to run on ARM. 

* Code Translation:
When running .NET on ARM, the CLR often uses a technique called "Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation" to translate the intermediate language (IL) code into native machine code for the specific processor. In some cases, like when running x64 code on ARM via emulation (e.g., Rosetta on Apple Silicon), the JIT compilation process can be slower than native execution on x64. 

* Performance Disparities in Specific Scenarios:
Some users have reported significant performance differences, particularly in scenarios involving garbage collection (GC) and write barriers (WB). For example, one user reported that a JSON benchmark was slower on ARM64, with larger memory usage and more GC cycles than on x64 according to GitHub user Kunalspathak. Another GitHub user highlighted that ARM64 might require more memory loads for WB operations compared to x64. 

* Hardware Differences:
Even with optimized JIT compilation and native code execution, differences in hardware capabilities between ARM and x64 processors can contribute to performance variations. 

However, it's important to note that: 

* Performance improvements:
.NET and hardware vendors are continually working on optimizing performance for both architectures. ARM64-specific optimizations are being implemented in the .NET runtime, and ARM processors are becoming more powerful.
* Specific workloads:
The performance gap can vary depending on the type of application and the specific tasks being performed. Some workloads might see minimal differences, while others might be more noticeably affected by the architecture differences.
* Future trends:
As ARM processors continue to evolve and become more integrated into various computing devices, the performance gap between ARM64 and x64 is likely to narrow.
