For running Jenkins CI/CD builds on multiple architectures, we need a Jenkins setup with slaves nodes on different architectures. After adding nodes to the Jenkins server the Label needs to be associated with the Node to identify the build target. We can make use of a Jenkins Pipeline to run our build/test on different nodes.
